            <p>This sub-$500 has a lot going for it, including nearly 13 hours of battery life. Plus, according to our reviewer, it's the most attractive Chromebook they've ever reviewed. That's high praise considering less premium laptops tend to look like unassuming gray or black slabs.</p>

            <p>But let's leave the Spin 714's dark-gray finish with the gold accents for a minute and take a look beneath the chassis. With its Intel Core i5-1335U CPU, don't expect the system to do any heavy data crunching or run AutoCAD, but it can do productivity tasks, web work, or stream as much video as you like. On the Geekbench 6 test, it defeated the HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook which costs $300 more â€” 6,335 vs. 4,263.</p>
            
            <p>The tables were turned on the JetStream 2.0 benchmark, which tests how quickly large web pages load. The Chromebook Spin 714 achieved a score of 250.2, which beats the Chromebook average (240), but not the HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook (256.7).</p>
            
            <p>Spin 714 also scored a win on our battery test lasting for 12 hours and 43 minutes, eclipsing the Dragonfly's time of 9:17. From a price-to-battery life standpoint, that's the best result we've ever seen.</p>
            
            <p>As long as you don't need any Windows or macOS software, the Acer Chromebook Spin 714 is an outstanding and affordable option.</p>
