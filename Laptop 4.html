           <p>The LG Gram SuperSlim puts every other so-called ultrabook on notice with its 15.6-inch display, 0.49-inch thickness and unbelievable 2.18-pound weight. It is mind-bending that there is a real functioning laptop inside when you pick this thing up.</p>

<P>Even more amazingly, it isn't a weak laptop that can't do more than browse the web and generate documents, the Intel Core i7-1360p processor, 32GB of RAM, 512GB of RAM and an Intel Iris Xe GPU give you enough oomph to outperform the competition. Let's not forget that it also features a 15.6-inch OLED display, while coming in lighter than many 13-14-inch ultrabooks.</p>

<P>The Gram SuperSlim proved its mettle in our benchmarks delivering a Geekbench 5 score that cleared the mainstream premium laptop average and even the M2 MacBook Air! The SSD is no slouch either, delivering a file transfer rate of 1,692.4MBps, well above the premium average of 1,362.7MBps.</p>

<p>Thin, light and powerful? You're probably waiting to hear that it has terrible battery life. Think again! Apparently LG also shoved a large battery in the pocket dimension inside the Gram SuperSlim, because it lasted 11 hours and 38 minutes on our battery test.</p>

<p>So what's the downside? There's one magic trick that LG can't manage and creating extra depth for the keyboard, which our reviewer found a little shallow for their liking. It's not a dealbreaker, but worth considering if you are churning out thousands of words a day on the Gram SuperSlim.</p>

<p>That shallow keyboard is a small price to pay for the rest of what you are getting though, which is why the LG Gram SuperSlim earned 4.5 stars and an Editor's Choice award. If you need an ultraportable ultrabook, look no further.</p>
