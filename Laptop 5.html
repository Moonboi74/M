           <p>I'd be remiss if I didn't add the Dell XPS 15 (9530) to the list. This laptop is quietly a beast, which I could put in the creative professional realm. It can also serve as a powerful productivity machine and a passable gaming rig. It’s got a stunning 3.5K OLED touchscreen paired with powerful speakers that just scream multimedia machine.</p>

            <p>Armed with its 2.4-GHz Intel Core i7-13700H processor with 32GB of RAM, the XPS 15 (9350) holds up well against most of its competitors. In the Geekbench 6 test, it hit 12,171, crushing the 7,803 premium laptop average. It's a strong result that is only truly blown away by the M3 Max MacBook Pro 16, which reached 20,863. It's worth noting that the MacBook was $1,200 more than our Dell XPS 15 if the price matters to you.</p>
            
            <p>Looking at real-world tasks, the XPS 15 sped through transcoding a 4K video to 1080p in 5 minutes and 1 second, again well ahead of the 8:18 category average and competitors like the Vivobook Pro 16 (5:50) and Galaxy Book 3 (5:26). The M3 Max MacBook does come out ahead again though at 2:36. On the Laptop Mag Battery Test, the XPS 15 lasted 8 hours and 58 minutes, which is quite a bit shy of the MacBook Pro’s ludicrous 18:05.</p>
            
            <p>Along with the below-average battery life, the XPS 15 counts a mushy keyboard as a flaw. The latter is a minor annoyance compared to the battery life. Still, if you ensure that the Dell XPS 15 is always near an outlet, it shouldn't be a problem, especially with all the laptop's power. The Dell XPS 15 is the ultimate jack-of-all-trades system with something for everyone. If macOS, the price, or the weaker gaming support aren't a strike against it for you, the MacBook Pro 16 M3 Max deserves consideration for the high-performance crown as well.</p>
